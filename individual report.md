# Individual Report - Cody Ludwig 9989819

### Wednesday 30/08/17: 
Today we threw some ideas into the mix about what we could possible make our app on. Each of us had a reasonable understanding of what communication software we were going to use (being Slack). Due to a couple of our team mate not being there we decided to leave it as mostly a day to discuss possibilities and to not commit to anything in particular until we have our full team.

### Thursday 31/09/17:
Today our group discussed further into detail what our project was going to achieve. Out of this we came up with a timetable reader app that uses an API to source and update timetable data when a student scans their ID card with the phoneâ€™s camera. This would all be achieved using Slack to communicate, Trello to plan, xCode and Swift for the code, and ARKit for the camera barcode scanning. We also decided that Matt would be the leader of this scourge. 

### Wednesday 06/09/17: 
On this day Matt headed up some planning on Trello with our watchful eyes over his shoulder and we all established what areas each of us will be focusing on. I was assigned the xCode part of the report and the Timesheet display part of the app. My goal with the timesheet display is to display the info fetched for the user in a timetable-like format with some extra functionalities such as mildly detailed info on the class which they having coming up. 

### Thursday 07/09/17: 
Today we further discussed the roles which we each have, and we starting on our wireframes for each page. Our design at this stage will be something similar to snapchat in the likes of it will open up to the camera scanning screen with other functions just floating in the UI to navigate away to the timetable and settings etc.
